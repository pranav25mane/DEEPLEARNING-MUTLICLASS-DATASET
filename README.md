Deep Learning Multiclass Classification

This project demonstrates the development of a deep learning model to perform multiclass classification. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras.

Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation

Loaded the dataset for a multiclass classification task.

Cleaned the data and ensured it was ready for modeling.

Encoded the target variable into numerical format suitable for multiclass prediction (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for unbiased evaluation.

2. Model Architecture

Built a Sequential neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.

Added multiple Dense (fully connected) layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to capture complex patterns.

Used a softmax activation function in the output layer to handle multiple classes.

3. Model Compilation

Defined an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to minimize the loss function.

Selected categorical cross-entropy as the loss function (since this is a multiclass problem).

Included accuracy as the primary performance metric.

4. Training

Trained the model on the training dataset.

Used epochs and batch size to iteratively improve learning.

Monitored loss and accuracy during training.

5. Evaluation

Tested the model on unseen test data.

Evaluated performance using classification accuracy.

Generated predictions and compared them with actual class labels.

Tech Stack

Python: Data manipulation and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy).
